# Timer-Calculation-Practical-Task
Language: Kotlin  Database: Room Database with MVVM structure (Data Binding) 

Practical points: 
Common Screen: 
1. Create one activity which will have two buttons Q1 & Q2. 
2. On click of Q1 user moved to another activity and task Q1 loads. 
3. On click of Q2 user moved to another activity and task Q2 loads.

 #Q1: Timer Calculation 
1. There will be one fragment which contains two time pickers, one go button, one 
recyclerview to show list and Textview to print the unique numbers. 
2. When I select both and click on the go button then you need to count the time between 
both times. 
a.  E.g if I select 11:12:13 and in other 11:12:15 then total list will include [11:12:13, 
11:12:14, 11:12:15] 
3. Now from that list you need to find a list of unique numbers and sum the numbers.

#Q2: Timer Task
# Details: 
● First Screen: 
  1. There will be 2 buttons at bottom timer and dashboard. 
  2. Default selected will be a timer. 
  3. On click on Timer screen 2 will be displayed. 
  4. On click on Dashboard screen 3 will be displayed. 

● Second Screen: 
  1. There will be one timer and two buttons Start & Stop. 
  2. When clicking on the start button the timer will start and the start button 
will be changed to pause. 
  3. If the user clicks on the Stop button then the screen will reset as current. 
  4. If the user clicks on the pause button then it will pause the timer and text 
will change to resume. 
  5. There will be one recyclerview which will note down the date and timer 
time. 
  6. Once the timer stops then all the data will be stored in the database. 

● Third Screen: 
  1. There will be an extended recyclerview which shows all round as per date 
and time.
